# Ali's Portfolio

## Technologies 

* Jquery
* JavaScript
* Ajax
* Bootstrap 
* CSS
* HTML

## Process/Approach

* I wanted my portfolio to be simple and clean, while still showcasing the CSS and JavaScript skills that I've learned in this program. I started with building the basic playout for each topic and then expanded from there. In the future I'd like to perfect my CSS skill with this portfolio and clean up my code. 

## Wins and Challenges 

* The biggest challenge for me way deciding on the style of the page and thinking through exactly what i need to creaete it. I built a lot of div's that were never used, and added alot of features over time to finally reach the design I wanted. The JavaScript for animations on  my page took a lot of research and fine tuning. I'd love to go back and clean it up and work on understanding it better.
